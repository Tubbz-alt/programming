# Programming at SLAC

## What this is

This repository is oriented around tools, education, best practices,
and general knowledge around programming and software development across the
lab. We hope it will empower anyone who writes softare at the lab, whether it's
analysis scripts in python, firmware for daq systems, web apps for
communications, or just simple bash scripts. 

## Discussions
Feel free to use the issues to discuss anything. For educations material,
and also feel free to make pull requests updating things as needed.

Also, we have a Slack channel #programming channel on https://slac.slack.com,
which is a good resource, as well as #comp-general.
